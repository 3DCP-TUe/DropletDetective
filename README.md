# Droplet Detective
Droplet Detective aims to bundle the tools and methodologies that are used to perform the so called "slugs test". This is an experimental method that allows for the determination of the tensile strength of concrete and other materials by evaluation the droplet size as the material separates when exiting a nozzle. 

This repository contains:
- a Python script that allows for the continuous logging of load cell measurements
- a Matlab script that allows for the detection of invidual droplets from a log file of a load cell on which droplets have fallen.
- a Matlab script that allows for the estimation of droplet volume from a single image. Based on the assumption that the droplet is axisymmetric.

## Installation

The current release is tested with Python 3.12 and Matlab R2023b and requires the following libraries:
- To connect to an OPC UA server: opcua-asyncio (py -m pip install asyncua)

## Explanation of the files

### Data acquisition

Files related to data acquisition are located in the **[src/acquisition/](src/acquisition/)** directory and include the following files and folders:

- **[load_cell.py](src/acquisition/load_cell.py):** Python script that acquires the load cell data through an OPC_UA connection with the HBM ClipX. 

### Data analysis

Files related to data analysis are located in the **[src/analysis/](src/analysis/)** directory and include the following files and folders:

- **[analysisLoadCell.m](src/analysis/analysisLoadCell.m):** MATLAB script that reads the data from the raw_data/load_cell folder and computes the individual droplet mass, corresponding yield stress, and mass flow rate.
- **[imagesToVolumes.m](src/analysis/imagesToVolumes.m):** MATLAB script that reads images from the raw_data_images folder and computes the droplet volume to save it in volumes.csv.
- **[analysisVolumes.m](src/analysis/analysisVolumes.m):** MATLAB script that computes volumes_grouped.csv and volumetric_flow.csv from volumes.csv.
- **[COMBINEDslugsRawToProcessed.m](src/analysis/COMBINEDslugsRawToProcessed.m):** MATLAB scripts that performs all of the above tasks when available data is present.

## Version numbering
Droplet Detective uses the following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) scheme: 

```
0.x.x ---> MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
x.0.x ---> MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner
x.x.0 ---> PATCH version when you make backward-compatible bug fixes
```
