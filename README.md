# DropletDetective
DropletDetective aims to bundle the tools and methodologies that are used to perform the so called "slugs test". This is an experimental method that allows for the determination of the tensile strength of concrete and other materials by evaluation the droplet size as the material separates when exiting a nozzle. 

This repository contains:
- a Python script that allows for the continuous logging of load cell measurements
- a Matlab script that allows for the detection of invidual droplets from a log file of a load cell on which droplets have fallen.

## Installation

The current release is tested with Python 3.12 and Matlab R2023b and requires the following libraries:
- To connect to an OPC UA server: opcua-asyncio (py -m pip install asyncua) 

## Coordinates

Gantry robot coordinates for droplet test at TU/e are `X8281 Y4074 Z900`.

## Version numbering

The DropletDetective project uses the following versioning scheme: 

```
0.x.x ---> MAJOR version: Incompatible changes; for example, restructuring the database format and metadata files.
x.0.x ---> MINOR version: Functionality added in a backward-compatible manner; for example, new system components.
x.x.0 ---> PATCH version: Small backward-compatible changes; for example, small corrections in a component property.
```
