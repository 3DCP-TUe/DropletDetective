# Droplet Detective
Droplet Detective aims to bundle the tools and methodologies that are used to perform the so called "slugs test". This is an experimental method that allows for the determination of the tensile strength of concrete and other materials by evaluation the droplet size as the material separates when exiting a nozzle. 

This repository contains:
- a Python script that allows for the continuous logging of load cell measurements
- a Matlab script that allows for the detection of invidual droplets from a log file of a load cell on which droplets have fallen.
- a Matlab script that allows for the estimation of droplet volume from a single image. Based on the assumption that the droplet is axisymmetric.

## Version numbering
Droplet Detective uses the following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) scheme: 

```
0.x.x ---> MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
x.0.x ---> MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner
x.x.0 ---> PATCH version when you make backward-compatible bug fixes
```

## Open science statement

We are committed to the principles of open science to ensure that our work can be reproduced and built upon by others. Our approach includes the following key points:

- Reproducibility: We strive to make our work reproducible by sharing detailed methodologies and data.
- Unique Resources and Data: We have equipment and facilities that are not available at other institutes. We generate data that other institutes cannot produce, and we share this data openly.
- Data and Software Sharing: We share our data and software and encourage others to do the same. If others use our data and software, they must also share their software and data under similar terms.

To support these principles, we license our software under the General Public License version 3 or later (free to use, with attribution, share with source code) and our data and documentation under CC BY-SA (free to use, with attribution, share-alike). By adhering to these principles, we aim to encourage an open and collaborative scientific community. We expect that if you use our resources, you will do the same.
